Unit Tests:
1.  A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

Expectation: The user can input two numbers and get an accurate product returned by the function.

Specifications: 
  Use the Multiply function
  Two variables (x,y)
  One number returned
  Expect answer will be correct
  Expect answer will be same significant digits as variables
  Expect answer will not be equal to an incorrect number.

 2.  A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
 Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
 ...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15] 

 Expectation: The concatOdds function will return a single array that only contains the odd numbers from both arrays, in ascending order.

 Specifications:
   Expect only odd numbers will be returned by the function
   Expect the numbers will be ordered from smallest to largest
   Expect unexpected inputs will be rejected if not a part of the original array
   Expect duplicated numbers will result in an error

Functional Tests
A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. 
They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

Expectation: The checkout feature will allow the user to checkout as a guest or logged-in user, but they will be asked if they want to create an acocunt or log in
if they check out as a guest.

Specifications:
  If the cart is empty the icon will show an empty cart 
  Adding an item to the cart will prompt the user to login, create an account, or checkout as guest 
  If the user logs in, all site features (such as discounts and coupons) will be applied to their order 
  If the user creates an account, they will be logged in afterwards and all available features and discounts will be applied to their order
  If the user checks out as a guest, they will miss out on the extra features and discounts available to logged-in users
  One behavior the prompt misses is that sometimes registered users just want a quick checkout and may choose guest in order to obtain it
  If a registered user checks out as a guest, they should be prompted to login by matching their email address or phone number 
  to information already stored in the system.
